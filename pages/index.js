Here's the fixed version with missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// ... rest of the file remains the same ...

              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

I added the missing closing brackets and braces to properly close the JSX structure. The main fixes were:

1. Added closing `</p>` tag
2. Added closing `</div>` tags 
3. Added closing `</section>` tag
4. Added closing `</Layout>` tag
5. Added closing brace and parenthesis for the component function

The rest of the file content remains unchanged. The fixes ensure proper nesting and closure of all opened elements and code blocks.
